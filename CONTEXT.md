Last updated: 2026-06-05

## Current State

- Repository: https://github.com/ajason13/swing-sync
- Default branch: `main`
- Latest merged PR: https://github.com/ajason13/swing-sync/pull/1
- Latest merge commit: `45e4d54`
- Current completed task: `SS-001 Select license, dependency policy, and SBOM workflow`
- Active branch: `ss-002-safety-terms`
- Active task: `SS-002 Draft sports injury waiver and educational-use terms`
- Active PR: https://github.com/ajason13/swing-sync/pull/2

## Completed Foundation

SS-001 established the project compliance baseline:

- Apache-2.0 root license and project NOTICE.
- Dependency license policy in `docs/licensing.md`.
- Model licensing placeholder and no-model-binary policy in `docs/models-licensing.md`.
- Root `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.
- CycloneDX SBOM generation to `docs/sbom.json`.
- GitHub Actions compliance workflow on Node 22.
- Synthetic license fixtures for GPL, MPL, and MIT policy checks.
- Production-scoped NOTICE aggregation with deterministic fixture validation.
- Bundle license validation with a synthetic bundled GPL package.

## Verification Baseline

PR #1 passed GitHub Actions:

- Workflow: `Dependency and License Compliance`
- Run: https://github.com/ajason13/swing-sync/actions/runs/26996587662
- Result: success

Expected local commands:

```bash
nvm use
npm ci
npm run license:audit
npm run verify:bundle-license-fixture
npm run sbom:generate
npm run build
npm run compliance:verify
```

## Active Task

`SS-002 Draft sports injury waiver and educational-use terms` is in progress on
branch `ss-002-safety-terms`.

Acceptance criteria from Notion:

- Draft assumption-of-risk and release-of-liability language for review.
- State feedback is educational and not medical or professional athletic instruction.
- Define consent gate before first analysis.
- Add prompt constraints that avoid diagnosing pain or prescribing unsafe movements.

Planned/active artifacts:

- `docs/safety-terms.md`: product-compliance draft language for human/legal
  review, including assumption of risk, release of liability, educational-use
  boundaries, local-first privacy, consent-gate requirements, prompt
  constraints, and a review checklist.
- `src/main.ts`: minimal first-analysis consent gate scaffold that stores only
  local acknowledgement state.
- `scripts/verify-safety-terms.js`: safety-boundary regression checks wired
  into `npm run compliance:verify`.
- `docs/ss-002-research-disposition.md`: Gemini Deep Research disposition,
  separating adopted guidance from revised, deferred, or rejected
  recommendations.

SS-002 verification on 2026-06-05:

- `npm run safety:verify` passed.
- `npm run build` passed.
- `npm run compliance:verify` passed.
- `git diff --check` passed.
- Gemini Deep Research response received and distilled into
  `docs/ss-002-research-disposition.md`.
- Initial Claude audit returned conditional pass with two blockers: add a runtime
  consent check in the analysis click handler, and strengthen
  `scripts/verify-safety-terms.js` to avoid false confidence.
- Claude re-review returned PASS and granted sign-off for PR creation after the
  blocker fixes.
- PR #2 created: https://github.com/ajason13/swing-sync/pull/2
- Claude PR review returned APPROVED FOR MERGE with no blockers. Remaining
  notes are future-story items: verifier regex maintenance, unit tests for
  consent helpers once a real analysis pipeline exists, adversarial prompt tests
  for the first AI coaching pipeline, and private-browsing consent UX.

Pending SS-002 gates:

- Legal/human review of draft assumption-of-risk and release-of-liability copy
  remains pending before public release.
- PR #2 merge is the next engineering step after CI/repository review policy is
  satisfied.

## Operating Notes

- Keep legal language framed as product/compliance drafting, not legal advice.
- Preserve the local-first privacy posture: no raw swing video upload by default.
- User-facing safety copy should be clear, plain, and explicit before analysis.
- Any connected model or coaching prompt must avoid medical diagnosis, pain triage, or aggressive mechanical prescriptions.
- Observability: SS-002 adds no runtime logging, telemetry, remote calls, or raw
  video handling. Consent acknowledgement is local-only browser state.
