Last updated: 2026-06-04

## Current State

- Repository: https://github.com/ajason13/swing-sync
- Default branch: `main`
- Latest merged PR: https://github.com/ajason13/swing-sync/pull/1
- Latest merge commit: `f604d3481ade2b47797cd2944c8176d14b4c91b1`
- Current completed task: `SS-001 Select license, dependency policy, and SBOM workflow`

## Completed Foundation

SS-001 established the project compliance baseline:

- Apache-2.0 root license and project NOTICE.
- Dependency license policy in `docs/licensing.md`.
- Model licensing placeholder and no-model-binary policy in `docs/models-licensing.md`.
- Root `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.
- CycloneDX SBOM generation to `docs/sbom.json`.
- GitHub Actions compliance workflow on Node 22.
- Synthetic license fixtures for GPL, MPL, and MIT policy checks.
- Production-scoped NOTICE aggregation with deterministic fixture validation.
- Bundle license validation with a synthetic bundled GPL package.

## Verification Baseline

PR #1 passed GitHub Actions:

- Workflow: `Dependency and License Compliance`
- Run: https://github.com/ajason13/swing-sync/actions/runs/26996587662
- Result: success

Expected local commands:

```bash
nvm use
npm ci
npm run license:audit
npm run verify:bundle-license-fixture
npm run sbom:generate
npm run build
npm run compliance:verify
```

## Next Task

Start `SS-002 Draft sports injury waiver and educational-use terms`.

Acceptance criteria from Notion:

- Draft assumption-of-risk and release-of-liability language for review.
- State feedback is educational and not medical or professional athletic instruction.
- Define consent gate before first analysis.
- Add prompt constraints that avoid diagnosing pain or prescribing unsafe movements.

Suggested branch: `ss-002-safety-terms`

## Operating Notes

- Keep legal language framed as product/compliance drafting, not legal advice.
- Preserve the local-first privacy posture: no raw swing video upload by default.
- User-facing safety copy should be clear, plain, and explicit before analysis.
- Any connected model or coaching prompt must avoid medical diagnosis, pain triage, or aggressive mechanical prescriptions.
